A simple Chat Client that ties into a Web Socket maintained locally.

This client uses Redux to handle the state management of chats/users and authentication and is merely a simple tool
for playing around with Container/Components and a Redux Store.  

The actual Client will not work without the internal server this connects to. 

Secondary work, would be to build an Express Sercer on Node that can fire up websockets for internal chat.
